**Galaxy-P platform for Proteomics!**

#### ***Not just for genomics anymore: Galaxy for Proteomic analysis*** 
_Did you think that Galaxy is just for genomic data analysis? Not anymore. Come to this workshop to learn how Galaxy can be used for Mutli-omic data analysis (proteogenomic and metaproteomic) and also applications that cross the ‘omic domains. This workshop will provide attendees the opportunity to take Galaxy for a 'test drive' in analyzing MS-based proteomics data. Attendees will have the opportunity to access a Galaxy instance and a walk through of GalaxyP workflows for proteogenomic and metaproteomic data analysis. An overview of the current state of software available in Galaxy for proteomics and multi-omics applications will also be provided._ 

**Target Audience**: _Core directors, personnel, data scientists and researchers interested in proteomics, multi-omics and microbiome research. Previous experience with Galaxy or other informatics solutions is not necessary._



**_Attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop computer to participate._**

**Workshop goals:**

_1. Introduce the Galaxy framework as a solution for data analysis across proteomic domains._

_2. Provide hands-on experience to attendees in using Galaxy._

_3. Demonstrate use of Galaxy for a proteogenomic and metaproteomics analysis._

_4. Lay the foundation for attendees to implement Galaxy at their own facility or institution to meet ‘omics’ data analysis needs (either specific to one domain or for multi-omics)._

**Workshop Schedule:**

 _Wednesday, June 28, 2017 (12:30 pm - 3:00 pm)_
 
1. Instructions on how to access the resource (30 minutes)

2. Introduction to Proteomics (1 hour)

3. Multi-omics Workflows ( 1 hour)

   -Proteogenomics Workflow: Used for filtering identified peptides from proteogenomic analyses.
 
   -Metaproteomics Workflow: Used for identifying genera from identified peptides from metaproteomics analysis.

At the end of the workshop, attendees will have working knowledge of MS-based proteomics tools; experience in setting up basic workflows for protein identification, as well as more advanced workflows in proteogenomics and metaproteomics.
